# AsianHack2019

So, this was my first ever experience working with the arduino (UNO). 
It was our hackathon project that me along with 3 other team members were participatd as a team named "PRO-BEGINNNERS".
It was great working with them and making this project successful. 

Basically, we used an arduino UNO to build a system that could turn off the motor when the water tank gets full
(or reaches some pre defined level) and turn on the motor after the water tank is emptied (or, falls below some predefined level).
The concept is simple and maily focuses on avoiding the manual operation of the water motors. However, our core motto was to
prevent the wastage of water due to overflow. 

Devices needed :
  - Arduino UNO    * 1
  - 6V relay       * 1
  - 10K resistors  * 4
  - 5V battery     * 1
  - Motor          * 1
  - Jumper wires
  - Bread Board
